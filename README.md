# US-States-Application

This application was created for the final project of my Back-End Development I class.

There were three goals given to us:

1. Take data from a JSON file and display it on the page based on what state the user selected.

2. Use MongoDB to store fun facts about at least 3 states and display them on their respective pages.

3. Allow users to filter by contiguous and non-contiguous states.

I decided to take it a step further and build a more approachable front-end as well.






# Update (3/30/2023)
The civil services CDN no longer works. The state flags have been updated to a new CDN, but State Seals, Maps, and Landscapes are no longer supporter.
